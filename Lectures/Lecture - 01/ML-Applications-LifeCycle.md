ML - subdomain of Artificial Intelligence<br>
DL - subdomain of ML
### What is ML?
ML gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Accoding to human life, Experience is directly proportional to Performance.
### Interesting Point:
Normally when you do coding, you provide data(input), It passes through some rules or set of instructiuons (program you have written) and finally you get output.
### But In ML, you provide data(input) and output, ML will generate set of instructions through which you input can be converted into output.

### One Analogy (ETP): 
Let suppose:

E (Experience) = 10,000 Games<br>
T (Task) = Playing checker<br>
P (Probability) = Probability of winning

### ML Applications:
- Speech Recognition (i.e. Goodle Assistance)
- Spam Filtering (on the basis of subject, content or attachment)
- Youtube videoes recommendation
- Automatic Filtering of images (Google photoes)
- DeepL translator
- Grammarly
- Text Recognition
- Video Cameras (object recognition or depth(ray based) recognition)
- Inertial Sensors (To check Are focused or not!)
- Accelometer (For rate of change of velocity)
- Gyroscope (For Rotational angles)
- Magnetometer (Location of device from earth center)

P.S. if we apply ETP anology on spam filtering application, we have:<br>
T = Filter Emails<br>
E = Prior Information (# of emails which have been filtered with this filtered)<br>
P = Probability of finding correct number of spam emails in spam folder<br>
P.S. Not cameras but Depth recoginition or Sensor based devices to be used for daily basis activities, do not violate privacy.

### Understanding of basic movements(sit, stand, bend, eat, drink) help in understanding/recognition of complex activities.
### ML is sensor based Analaysis

### ML life cycle
1 - Data Acquisition (حاصل) : Adequate/Efficient data for testing<br>
2 - Data Preparation : If there is segmention(e.g. Cat with dog), or background removal or clustered image(Cat behind the chair) etc then you need to prepare it.<br>
3 - Feature Extraction : Need to extract meaning features/movements<br>
4 - Train Model : Smjo what data is this!<br>
5 - Test Model<br>
6 - Evaluate and Improve : Either model has trained good or bad?How can be improved(by increasing Experience so increasing input data)

### Types of ML:
- Supervised ML
- Unsupervised ML

### Supervised ML :
When you provide data and get correct answer.<br>
Lets plot a graph between adat and answers.<br>
Ap k pas kuch marlay zameen hai(size), jin k against kuch prices ap ny apny model ko learn krwai hon gi(price), you plot graph between size(x-axis) and price(y-axis)
I plot some points on graph against size and prices. Mera dost muje kehta hai k me ny 9 marlay ka makan khreedna hai, apny model ko use krty huway btao kya price aye gi <br>
Now it is your approach which method you choose to help your friend, either plot Linear(average) line or plot non linear line(passing through those points). Theses methods
also play a role in determining performance of your model. You can apply any technique to predict data. 

Supervised ML includes
- Regression 
- Classification

### Regression : ML which provides continuous answer. (Example : see above Marla-Price scenario)
### Classification : Discrete answers (YES! or NO!), Categorization
